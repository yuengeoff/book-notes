# A Mind for Numbers
by Barbara Oakley

## Chapter 2: easy does it
* there are two modes of learning: focused mode and diffuse mode
* in order to learn efficenctly we must learn to switch between the two modes. 
* Focused mode involves a direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential, analytical approaches. 
* Diffused mode is best used to understand or figure out something new. 
* Einstellung effect =: your simple initial thought prevents a better idea or solution from being found. 
* Pomodoro technique =: set a timer for twenty five minutes and pout yourself toward doing a twenty five minute interlude of work focused on a task 
* The idea of the Pomodoro is, "Don;t worry about finishing the task - just worry about working on it." 
* pg 19: The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be. 
* pg 24: (when you procrastinate), you are increasing your stress level because you know you have to complete what feels like an unpleasant task. 

## Chapter 3: learning is creating
* It is the distributed use of focused and diffuse mode that allows us to learn the best - Consistency over time. 
* there are two types of memory: working memory and long-term memory
* Working memory has to do with what you are immediately and consciously processing. i.e repeat a phone number to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. 
* Long term memory is a storage warehouse, where once the items are there they generally stay put but is harder to retrieve. 
* Spaced repetition allows us to move items from working memory to long-term memory. 
* Sleep is a vital part of memory and learning. 
* If you go over the material right before taking a nap or going to sleep, or go even further to set it in mind that you WANT to dream about the material, you have an increase chance of dreaming about it. 

### General Diffuse-Mode Activators:
* Go to the gym 
* Play a sport
* Take a bath/shower
* Meditate
* Sleep 

## Chapter 4: chunking and avoiding illusions of competence 
* Conceptual chunks =: pieces of information that are bound together through meaning 
### How to create conceptual chunks
1. Focus your attention on the information you want to chunk, no distractions i.e television going in the background, checking your phone 
2. Undertand the basic idea you are trying to chunk 
3. Gain context so you see not just how but also when to use this chunk
* Reccall > Rereading 
* rewrite your notes during the evening after a lecture
* Merely glancing at the solution to a problem and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of he most common illusions of competence in learning
* **Pick a concept, read it over, then look away and see what you can recall. Then glance back, reread the oncept and try it again.**
* Lady luck favors the one who tries - you can't learn mathematics or science without includimg a healthy dose of practice and repetition. 
* Create index cards with the problem question on one side, and the question and solution steps on the other. 
* pg 76: Rather than devote a long session to the study or practice of the same skill or concept so that overlearning occurs, students should didvide their effort across several shorter sessions. Once they understand X, they should move onto something else and return to X some other day.

### Techniques for Limited Study Time
1. Read (but don't yet solve0 assigned homework and practice exam/quizzes 
2. Review lecture notes the following day (attend every lecture as much as possible) 
3. Rework lecture problems
